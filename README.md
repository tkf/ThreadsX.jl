## tl;dr

Add prefix `ThreadsX.` to functions from `Base` to get some speedup,
if supported.  Example:

```julia
julia> using ThreadsX

julia> ThreadsX.sum(gcd(42, i) == 1 for i in 1:10_000)
2857
```

To find out functions supported by ThreadsX.jl, just type
`ThreadsX.` + <kbd>TAB</kbd> in the REPL:

``````julia
julia> ThreadsX.
MergeSort       any             findlast        mapreduce       sort
QuickSort       count           foreach         maximum         sort!
Set             extrema         issorted        minimum         sum
StableQuickSort findall         map             prod            unique
all             findfirst       map!            reduce
``````

## Interoperability

### Rich collection support

The `reduce`-based functions support any collections that implement
[`SplittablesBase.jl`](https://github.com/tkf/SplittablesBase.jl)
interface including arrays, `Dict`, `Set`, and iterator
transformations.  In particular, these functions support iterator
comprehension:

```julia
julia> ThreadsX.sum(y for x in 1:10 if isodd(x) for y in 1:x^2)
4917
```

For advanced usage, they also support
[`Transducers.eduction`](https://juliafolds.github.io/Transducers.jl/dev/manual/#Transducers.eduction)
constructed with parallelizable transducers.

### OnlineStats.jl

`ThreadsX.reduce` supports an `OnlineStat` from
[OnlineStats.jl](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl) as the
first argument as long as it implements the
[merging interface](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStatsBase.jl#interface):

```julia
julia> using OnlineStats: Mean

julia> ThreadsX.reduce(Mean(), 1:10)
Mean: n=10 | value=5.5
```

## API

ThreadsX.jl is aiming at providing API compatible with `Base`
functions to easily parallelize Julia programs.

All functions that exist directly under `ThreadsX` namespace are
public API and they implement a subset of API provided by `Base`.
Everything inside `ThreadsX.Implementations` is implementation detail.
The public API functions of `ThreadsX` expect that the data structure
and function(s) passed as argument are "thread-friendly" in the sense
that operating on _distinct_ elements in the given container from
multiple tasks in parallel is safe. For example, `ThreadsX.sum(f,
array)` assumes that executing `f(::eltype(array))` and accessing
elements as in `array[i]` from multiple threads is safe.  In
particular, this is the case if `array` is a `Vector` of immutable
objects and `f` is a pure function in the sense it does not mutate any
global objects.  Note that it is not required and _not recommended_ to
use "thread-safe" array that protects accessing `array[i]` by a lock.

In addition to the `Base` API, all functions accept keyword argument
`basesize::Integer` to configure the number of elements processed by
each thread.  A large value is useful for minimizing the overhead of
using multiple threads.  A small value is useful for load balancing
when the time to process single item varies a lot from item to item.
The default value of `basesize` for each function is currently an
implementation detail.

ThreadsX.jl API is deterministic in the sense that the same input
produces the same output, independent of how `julia`'s task scheduler
decide to execute the tasks.  However, note that `basesize` is a part
of the input which may be set based on `Threads.nthreads()`.  To make
the result of the computation independent of `Threads.nthreads()`
value, `basesize` must be specified explicitly.

## Limitations

* Keyword argument `dims` is not supported yet.
* (There are probably more.)

## Implementations

Most of `reduce`-based functions are implemented as thin wrappers of
[`Transducers.jl`](https://github.com/tkf/Transducers.jl).

Custom collections can support ThreadsX.jl API by implementing
[`SplittablesBase.jl`](https://github.com/tkf/SplittablesBase.jl)
interface.
